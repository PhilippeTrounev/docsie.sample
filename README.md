A sample how to for Docsie.io.

Managing your content in multiple languages can be hard, you have to translate it, format it, style and maintain it. The fact that most of companies still do it in HTML is even worse. Luckily Docsie can easily help you write and translate your content and then allow you to dynamically serve your content to your customers in their preferred language. 

This is page was created for a demo, shown on youtube, to show how to publish created docsie content on github pages.
